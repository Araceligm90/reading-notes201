# CLASS 12 READING NOTES


### JavaScript Canvas


**What does < canvas > allow a developer to achieve?**

It allows you to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript.


**What is the importance of the closing </ canvas > tag?**

Because it contains explanatory information about the element if the browser wasn't to supoprt the < canvas > element.


**Explain what he getContext() method does.**

This methos returns a render context object. For example, the method takes one argument which is the type of context. If you use the '2d' to get a 2D rendering context, it will allow you to draw shapes, text iamges and other objects.



### Chart.js Documentation


**What is the chart.js and how can it be brought into your project?**

Chart.js allows you to create charts and include the major charts characteristics, such as chart types and elements, databases, customization, plugins, componens and tree-shaking. It is used to the Odd Duck project because we can translate the information provided about clicks into charts for a more visual display of the results. 


**List three different chart types you can create using Chart.js.**

1. Bar-funnel chart, which look exactly like a funnel. Placing at the top the highest or biggest data and at the bottom the lowest.

2. Geo chart, which is a map chart and will display the world. 

3. Sankey chart, which is weird and cool chart that looks like pipes or cables that go from side to side horizontally.



### Easily create stunning animated charts with Charts.js

**What are some advanteages to displaying data via a chart over a table?**

They are easier to look at and you can get plenty of information at a glance. Tables actually require for you to read the data to understand it.


**How could Chart.js aid your previously created applications visually?**

It would help to faster understand which location has sold more salmon cookies, for exmple. Or in the case of the Odd Duck project, a chart would be easier to understand rather than having to write/read a line for every round of images displayed.
