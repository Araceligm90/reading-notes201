# READING NOTES 4


**Reflections**

We continue to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build the foundations of our knowledge.



### LEARN HTML


**To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?**

The < a > element.


**The ‘href; attribute containing what information?**

The actual link.


**What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?**

You can add a ‘title’ attribute, which allows you to write any descriptive information about the link. You can also add a descriptive name of the link between the < a > element.


### CSS LAYOUT


**What is meant by ‘normal flow’?**

Normal flow is the way that elements are laid out in a web page by default if no CSS has been applied to modify them.


**What are the differences between ‘block-level’ and ‘inline’ elements?**
The content of a block-level element fills the space of the parent element containing it     and grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content.This could be any element such as < p >, < div >, etc. On the other hand, inline elements have the size of their content. Which means that it could be a single sentence within a < p > tag, for example.


***Block-level* positioning is the default for every html element.**


**Name a few advantages of using absolute positioning on an element.**

When using absolute positioning the elements around the space where it should be located close up together, which allows us to create features that don’t interfere with the other elements on the page, for example pop-up boxes, control menys, etc.


**What is the key difference between fixed position and absolute position?**

The key difference is that fixed position fixes the element in the chosen place, which means that it will be visible even if you scroll down or up.


### LEARN JSS


**Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.**

Declaring a function is just like declaring a variable, you are creating it. On the other hand, invoking it means that you are running the code that you have assigned to said function.


**What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?**

Parameters are sometimes called arguments, properties or even attributes, so there is no difference in between them because they are the same thing.



### MISCELLANEOUS


**Pick two benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.**

1. ‘Greater efficiency’ is the first benefit I would like to highlight. Two sets of eyes and two brains definitely work better than one. Pair programming will have two people focusing on the same ‘problem’ at the time, which means that if the driver, for example, makes a mistake while writing code, it will be more easily caught, as well as faster. That I see a clear advantage or pair programming as sometimes I get stuck trying to find an error which is right in front of me but that I fail to see because I am too focused on the problem.

2. The second benefit would definitely be ‘Learning from fellow students’, as everyone has their own way of learning or even the use of their own analogies to simplify the understanding of code. There is always room for improvement.
