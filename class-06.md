# CLASS 6 READING NOTES 



### JavaScript


**How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?**

An boject is a collection of related data and/or functionality. These usually consist of several variables and functions, which are referred to as properties and methods when they are inside objects.


**What are some advantages of creating objetcs literal?**

It is easier to transfer a series of structed, related data, for exmaple when sending a request to the server to be put in a database. Sending one object is more efficient than sending several items individually, and it is easier to work with than an array, when you want to identify individual items by name.


**How do objects differ from arrays?**

You can access any item or index by either using dot notation (person.age) or by typing the index word inside brackets (peron[ 'age' ]);


**Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.**

If an object property is held in a variable, you cannot use dot notation to access the value.


**Evaluate the code below. What does the term 'this' refer to and what is the advantage to using 'this'?**

'This' is a keyword and refers to the actual object the code is being written inside, and the advantage of using it is that it can be used in every object you create.




### Introduction to the DOM


**What is the DOM?**

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so tht programs can change the document, structure, style and content.


**Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.**

You can use JavaScript to create or modify elements within the DOM.
