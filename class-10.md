# CLASS 10 READING NOTES


### DEBUGGING


**Name some key differences between 'syntax error' and 'Logic error'.**

'Syntax error' means that there are some spelling errors in the code and that prevents it from workin gproperly. 'Logic error', on the other hand, means that the code is faulty.


**Explain a few error that you have encountered in the past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them**

1. Creating a for loop within a for loop but actually having closed the curly bracket of the first one, therefore it didn't run. A TA had to explain me why it wasn't working. 

2. Very silly one but good 15 minutes trying to figure out why the changes I was making in CSS wouldn't render when I opened the site with VSCode just to find out I hadn't linked it to the HTML file. I was about to request help from a TA and I am happy I didn't because he/she would have thought I was an idiot.

3. A lot of misspelling and even getting confused with the names I gave to variables. I named them very similarly and I thought I would be able to tell them apart afterwards but it just lasts while you work with them on the same day. When you pick up the day after you are lost.


**How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?**

This is proof that in order to be a good developer you have to be very meticulous and thorough. However the best advise that I have received so far is to test your code along the way. If you do this you will know exactly where the error lies and you won't need as long as fix it as if you did write a bunch of code to find out it doesn't work. It's easier to check and find a mistake in 10 lines of code than in 80.



### The JavaScript Debugger


**How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**

The JavaScript debugger is a dev tool that allows you to watch the value of variables ans set breakpoints, which are placed in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent the code from executing properly.


**Define what a breakpoint is.**

A breakpoint is a 'halt!' you give to a line of code so it doesn't cotinue to run.


**What is the call stack?**

This section shows what code was executed to get to the current line of code. What has happened to get where you are right now.
